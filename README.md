# AZ-GTe Polar Scope Mount

Removable 3D-printed mount to attach a Star Adventurer Mini polar scope to the AZ-GTe mount to enable rough polar alignment for use in equatorial mode.

> More details to come as the model is refined and tested.

## Versions

- **v1.0**: Initial concept; polar scope holder is *perfect* (slides into place with a satisfying snap), but the section that clips onto the mount is too flimsy

- **v1.1**: Much better connection to the mount, but still a little too flexible. Alignment is off by ~1.3 degrees

- **v1.2**: Slightly stiffer connection and alignment corrections. Consistent to within about 10 arcminutes when ensuring alignment in declination.
